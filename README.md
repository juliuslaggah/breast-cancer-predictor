# 🧠 Breast Cancer Predictor App (Streamlit + ML)

An intelligent, user-friendly web application for predicting breast cancer using machine learning. Built with **Streamlit**, it allows users to input data manually or upload CSV files for batch prediction. The app provides a stylish dark-themed UI, user authentication, and data visualization.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to assist in the early detection of breast cancer using a supervised machine learning model trained on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset**. It provides two main functionalities:

- **Single Prediction** – Users can input features through sliders.
- **Batch Prediction** – Upload a CSV file and receive predictions for multiple records.

**Key Features:**
- Streamlit-based interactive frontend
- Custom dark theme with CSS
- User authentication (Login/Registration)
- Batch diagnosis using uploaded CSV
- Real-time result display
- SHAP explanations (optional/future)
- Code is modular and well-documented
